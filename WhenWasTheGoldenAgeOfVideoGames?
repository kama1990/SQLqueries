# In this project, we'll explore the top 400 best-selling video games created between 1977 and 2020. 
We'll compare a dataset on game sales with critic and user reviews to determinate whether or not video games 
have improved as the gaming market has grown. 

# The project was created during the course 'Data Analyst in SQL' which I successfully completed.
